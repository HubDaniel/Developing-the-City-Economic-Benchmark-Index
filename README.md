## Developing the City Economic Benchmark Index

This is from the project at UCLA MSBA program. Instructor: William Yu

### Description:
It is usually more difficult to predict in the context of time series than in cross-sectional
data. One source for this difficulty is the trend and cyclical components of time series as opposed
to the static nature of cross-sectional data.
In a structural regression model, typical predictors/variables might not be sufficient to
capture/predict all the change of dependent variable, in particular for a very dynamic
environment with different kinds of trend and cycles.
For instance, a new strategy or a new marketing campaign of a company might have
different sales results in Dallas and Detroit. If product sales in Dallas increased but in Detroit
they decreased, our data analytics might suggest this strategy/marketing is neutral at best. In fact,
to determine whether it is effective, we need to control for the different economic dynamics of
these two cities: Dallas was booming while Detroit was not doing well in the past several years.
Regardless of specific corporate factor, your sales increase in Dallas and decrease in Detroit in
general are partly driven by local economic growth.
What we learned before about the mixed model (both structural and reduce-form) would
be a solution to control for the trend and cyclical components of Dallas and Detroit by adding,
e.g. AR(1) â€“ a lag term of the dependent variable.
Nevertheless, sometimes it might be challenge to run a mixed model. In this project, we
are going to develop a so called City Economic Benchmark Index (CEBI) in order to
control/predict the trend/cyclical component for a specific city during a period of time. That is,
you can put the CEBI as one of the predictors in your structural model to predict the dependent
variable. 

### Questions:
(1) Use the sample period of 2018 (January 2018 to October 2018) as the test-set to validate a
best and simple time series model for employment and wages. For instance, a model (across
all 60 metros) to give you the smallest RMSE in the test set. You can try all the models we
have learned in the class. Note: there should be seasonal component in the data.
(2) After you identify the model, use it to forecast all employment and wages for 60 metros up to
the end of 2019. Shows top three and bottom three metros for employment and wages growth
from November 2018 to November 2019.
(3) Remove the seasonal component of the data. Use some simple decomposition method we
learned in the class to remove the seasonal patterns of the data.
(4) Impute the missing values. In the wage data, some metros have missing values. Use some
simple imputation method to get the full sample.
(5) Convert the series from its original data to an index. The reason to do this is because the
index will make comparison across metro and time easier and more intuitively. That is all the
series in each metro will start as 100 in January 2010. And the series will have the exactly
same monthly growth rate as its original data.
(6) Combine both employment and wage into one index. One simple way is to take an average of
both employment and wage index. Note: depending on the nature of dependent variable, such
as company sales, the optimal weight of employment and wage could be reallocated. For
example: for an expensive restaurant, the wage composition might be necessary. For an
inexpensive fast food restaurant, e.g. McDonald, wage composition might not be important.
(7) Some Exploratory Test. Test if CEBI is a significant predictor for some other variables. For
instance, in Assignment 2, we analyze Zillow home price index. Run a simple regression to
see if CEBI could explain median home prices across the metro. E.g. Y = Median home
price percentage change from 1/2010 to 10/2018 for each metro. X = CEPI percentage
change from 1/2010 to 10/2018 for each metro.
(8) Convert the monthly index to weekly and daily index from January 2010 to December 2019
(including your forecast). The reason is to match your dependent variables, are mostly likely
to be daily or weekly.
